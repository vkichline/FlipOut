# FlipOut
A CTP6 K MVC app built from scratch, deomonstrating a neat steganography trick.

## Purpose
The intention is to start with a vague idea and explore it using git with Dev14 to fork, tinker, and and make things up as I go along

Ideally, this will expose some issues with making many changes, refactoring, merging, etc.
